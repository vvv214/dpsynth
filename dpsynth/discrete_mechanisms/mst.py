  """Computes an approximate maximum spanning tree with differential privacy.

  This is a differentially-private version of Kruskal's algorithm, where the
  best edge in each round is selected privately by the exponential mechanism.

  The differential privacy guarantees:
    1. zcdp_rho-zCDP if zcdp_rho is given.
    2. otherwise, it has the same privacy guarantees as the len(weights)-1
     Exponential Mechanism with parameter exponential_mechanism_epsilon.

  It is assumed that the weights are obtained from sensitivity 1 functions of
  the data (i.e., L1 norm between true and estimated marginal).

  Args:
    weights: A dictionary mapping pairs of attributes to the sensitivity 1
      measure of correlation between them.
    zcdp_rho: the zCDP budget to use for this mechanism.
    exponential_mechanism_epsilon: The epsilon parameter for the exponential
      mechanism. If None, the value is computed from zcdp_rho.
