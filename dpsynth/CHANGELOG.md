## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-15

Initial public release of DP Synth — a library for generating differentially
private synthetic tabular data using marginal measurement and Private-PGM
inference.

### Added

-   **Two execution modes**: In-memory local mode (via `dpsynth.generate()`,
    tested up to ~100M rows) and a distributed Apache Beam mode for larger
    workloads.
-   **Marginal-based mechanisms**: AIM, MST, Independent, and Direct mechanisms
    for selecting and measuring marginals under differential privacy.
-   **Closed-domain categorical attributes**: Standard categorical columns
    where the full domain is known upfront.
-   **Open-domain categorical attributes**: DP partition selection to privately
    discover significant categories when the domain is not known in advance.
-   **Numerical attributes**: Discretization with configurable
    `interval_handling` to control how intervals are converted back to values
    (`midpoint`, `sample`, or raw `pd.Interval`).
-   **Quickstart notebook**: Interactive Colab notebook demonstrating basic
    usage of the library.
-   **Documentation**: README with architecture overview, module-level READMEs,
    and work-in-progress notice.
